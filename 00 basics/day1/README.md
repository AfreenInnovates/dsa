### Time Complexity
- Rate at which the time increases, as the size of input increases
- Denoted by `Big O` notation: `O(time_taken)`
- Begin with worst case scenario
    - Avoid constants

### Space Complexity
- Also denoted by Big O notation
- Auxilary space + Input space
    - Auxilary space: space to solve problem
        - ex.: a = 10, b = 15; c = a + b; c is used to store the sum of a and b. We're creating auxillary space, to solve the problem. So here auxilary space = 1
    - Input space: space to store the input
        - from above a and b are input space, so 2. Total space complexity is O(3)

- 10^8 roughly equals to 1s
